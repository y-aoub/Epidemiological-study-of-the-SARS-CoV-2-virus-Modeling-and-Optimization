# Epidemiological study of the SARS-CoV-2 virus Modeling and Optimization
In this personal project, I was working on the modeling of the SARS-CoV-2 virus using the SIR and SEIR prediction models in order to determine the reproduction and contagion variables of the virus. I try to optimize each model by including other parameters to improve the quality of the results. Here are the results for Initial number of suspect cases set to 10000000.
